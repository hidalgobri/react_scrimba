//Props its actually a js object
1. What do props help us accomplish?

It helps us to make components reusable

2. How do you pass a prop into a component?

<ComponentName whateverPropName = "the_prop">

3. Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. `blahblahblah={true}`) to a native
   DOM element? (e.g. <div blahblahblah={true}>) Why or why not?
No you cant. Because html has predefined tags, and you cannot add a customizable one.   


4. How do I receive props in a component?
function Navbar(props) {
    return (
        <header>
            ...
            {props.whateverPropName}
        </header>
    )
}

2. How do you pass a prop into a component?
<MyAwesomeHeader title="???" />


3. Can I pass a custom prop (e.g. `blahblahblah={true}`) to a native
   DOM element? (e.g. <div blahblahblah={true}>) Why or why not?
No, because the JSX we use to describe native DOM elements will
be turned into REAL DOM elements by React. And real DOM elements
only have the properties/attributes specified in the HTML specification.
(Which doesn't include properties like `blahblahblah`)
